# Book Catalog

Book Catalog is a React-based web application that displays a collection of books in a clean, organized layout. Users can view book details including title, author, price, and cover image. 

The app features a "New" button card for adding books (UI only, no backend functionality) and uses a responsive grid and flex layout to ensure a consistent card size and spacing across different screen sizes.

Data is sourced from a JSON file (`books.json`) and displayed dynamically using React components.
